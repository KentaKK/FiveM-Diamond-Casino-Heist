# Diamond Casino Heist

## How to use this resource?

You only need have:
- Gamebuild 2189 or higher
- baseevents (default cfx resources)

Put the resource in your resource folder and start it! I can't add more flare than that sadly.

## Attributes 
You can use the [phone](https://github.com/PappaNiels/FiveM-iFruit-Phone) that I made earlier. There is kinda support for it. Have a look at the docs of that resource and you will figure that out.

## How to play?

There are a few commands that you need to use to start playing

The first one is:
```
/start_casinoheist
```

This command will create a 'lobby' if possible. This is determined if a heist crew is already robbing the casino. If so, it is not possible to create one. 
If you are able to create one, you will become partyleader. Go to the La Mesa arcade and enter it. You can set your options for the heist there.

The second one (heist leader only) is:
```
/invite_casinoheist [server id]
```

- server id: The server id of the player you want to invite.

This command will invite the player you submitted to the lobby. This will give a message to the player, letting them know that they received an invite.

And the last command (invitees only): 
```
/join_casinoheist
```

This command will make you join the heist, if and only if you have been invited. You will be teleported if the heist is starting.

# Contribution

Even if this project is buggy and not supported, you can still contribute. You can make issues to let me and others know what works and what doesn't. Or even make a pull request to add/change/remove code. 

# Support me!

You want to support me? Great! But to be honest, I don't really need the money. Just donate the money you wanted to give me to a charity like Unicef or The Red Cross. They need it more than I do.

# Last thing
Do not sell this resource. I have put a lot of effort into this and earning money over my back is not ok. Leave this open source and free for the community. Code can be used for your own projects, but please mention me in the readme or some other place or ask if you are allowed to. 

I also want to thank some people! They have helped me in the process of the making of this resource. First is all the collective members that maintain this platform. They have made an amazing platform, which continues to amaze me (in a good way). I've heard that they have a [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/fivem). Then the people who have helped me with some research. [Local9](https://github.com/Local9) and [logan](https://github.com/logan-mcgee). Both have made amazing stuff. Go have a look. And the last people for helping me test. [Gibby](https://forum.cfx.re/u/kypos/summary), david (went missing :( ), [Masi](https://github.com/MasiBall), [Yorick](https://github.com/Yorick20022) (from the txAdmin discord guild), [Sati](https://github.com/sati5M) and last but not least [Local9](https://github.com/Local9) *again*. 

Enjoy the hopefully bugless heist that was inspired by the original casino heist by Rockstar Games!
